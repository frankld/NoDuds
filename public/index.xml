      <description>&lt;p&gt;I hate to admit this, but the longer I teach improv, the more I see the benefit it has in people’s lives. Maybe I’ve drunk too much of the improv Kool-Aid over the years, but improv is a pretty amazing artform, and lately I’ve been struck with how improv can bring people together in a way that very few other things can.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just in case you haven’t noticed, the world is a pretty polarizing place lately. It&amp;rsquo;s hard not to think that you are right about the way that you view the world, and that everyone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t think the same way you do is wrong. Being on social media and constantly being bombarded with news is overwhelming and exhausting, and I usually struggle with finding a way to take a break from it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
